# Disease-Predictor

# Project Overview
This project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset to build predictive models that classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes.

# Key features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and encoding

Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Saving models for future use

Predicting heart disease from user-uploaded data

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

Kaggle API

Joblib
